gRPC - Google Remote Procedure Call 

Works over [[HTTP]], and gives more flexibility than [[1.REST| REST]], however there are not many libraries for front-end languages.

And it uses protobuf protocol

Each request consists of the following parts

- Request name
- Request body 
- Response body

```
syntax = "proto3";
import "google/protobuf/timestamp.proto";

service BillingService{
rpc GetBalance(GetBalanceRequest) returns (GetBalanceResponse);
}

message GetBalanceRequest{
    repeated string account_ids = 1;

}
message GetBalanceResponse{
    repeated Account accounts = 1;
}

message Account{
    string user_id = 1;
    string account_id = 2;
    AccountType account_type = 3;
    int64 balance = 4;
    string currecny = 5;
    google.protobuf.Timestamp updated_at = 6;
}

enum AccountType{
    ACCOUNT_TYPE_UNDIFINED = 0;
    ACCOUNT_TYPE_1 = 1;
    ACCOUNT_TYPE_2 = 2;
    ACCOUNT_TYPE_3 = 3;
}


```

**service BillingService** - could be described as package or group of methods

**GetBalance** - method name

**GetBalanceRequest** - Request, could be empty

**GetBalanceResponse** - Response, also could be empty

Each message (response or request) consists of several (may be no one) fields

Each field can be set 

```protobuf
//String value
string user_id = 1;

//Array of int8 
repeated int8 ids = 2;

//Custom message type
CustomMessage custom_message = 3;
```

## Why to use grcp instead of REST?
- No artificial restrictions in terms of method types
	- Besides the fact that we can use GET, POST etc. as we wish, it still may bring some frustration
- More flexible types
	- There are more variety of types, for example int4, timestamp etc.
- Speed
	- You can see on the graph that gRPC is much faster on big data
