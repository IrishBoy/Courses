When using any application, you face one of two fundamental approaches
- Local app
- Web application
The main difference between those types is the **need of the internet connection to operate.** 
Local apps, such as
- Calculator
- Camera
- etc.
Do not send or receive information from internet in order to work properly 
When it comes to the apps that require internet, the following ones may be listed
- Weather forecast
- News
- Chess game

Those apps uses internet.

Now, let's pick up the second category and break down the logic of their operating

So, we there is some logic on your device and some logic on the server

But how those two parts communicate?

Easy question - over the web

If we go deeper, there are some list of protocols that are being used for this communication (Application layer of [[OSI Model]])

-  [[HTTP]] - Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (or more secure HTTPS)
  
- [[FTP]] - File Transfer Protocol
  
- [[DNS]] - Domain Name System
  
- [[AMQP]]- Advanced Message Queuing Protocol
  
- [[SSH]]- Secure Shell
  
- etc.

# Request Response

Request-response model is the main basic patter when we talk about integrations. The logic behind it is very simple
- You make a request (call a method)
- You receive a response
Which means that by default no other system can get your response, as well as the fact that initiator and target are known.
Of course, we should mention here sync/asycn, but for now it is not that important
