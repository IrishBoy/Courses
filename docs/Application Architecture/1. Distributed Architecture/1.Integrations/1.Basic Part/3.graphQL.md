This API protocol also works over HTTP, however, it gives more flexibility in terms of requests.
graphQL focuses on getting specific information that is needed, without any extra
The principle is based on making sql-like requests
Basic request example
```
  
{
# Object name
  hero { 
# Object parametrs
    name

  }

}
```
Response
```
{
  "data": {
    "hero": {
      "name": "R2-D2"
    }
  }
}
```

It is also possible to filter

Request
```
{
  human(id: "1000") {
    name
    height
  }
}
```

Response

```
{
  "data": {
    "human": {
      "name": "Luke Skywalker",
      "height": 1.72
    }
  }
}
```


etc.
