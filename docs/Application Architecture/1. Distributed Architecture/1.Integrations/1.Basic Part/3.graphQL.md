This API protocol also works over [[HTTP]], however, it gives more flexibility in terms of requests.
graphQL focuses on getting specific information that is needed, without any extra.  

The principle is based on making sql-like requests retrieving exact information you need


For example, let's imagine that we have a service that is responsible for movies, directors etc.

Case 1:

You need to get director's birthdate, but in the director model there are 30 additional fields that you don't really need

Case 2:
You need to get name of directors fathers dog sister, with other API types you would need to make many requests, with graphQL you can extract required information with one request. 


Basic request example
```
  
{
# Object name
  hero { 
# Object parametrs
    name

  }

}
```
Response
```
{
  "data": {
    "hero": {
      "name": "R2-D2"
    }
  }
}
```

It is also possible to filter

Request
```
{
  human(id: "1000") {
    name
    height
  }
}
```

Response

```
{
  "data": {
    "human": {
      "name": "Luke Skywalker",
      "height": 1.72
    }
  }
}
```


etc.
