As you can observe, it is really simple message queue/ESB
In NATS, messages are published to subjectsâ€”hierarchical string values that subscribers monitor to receive messages. Known for its high throughput and low latency, NATS supports multiple message formats, including JSON, XML, and plain text.

So, what are pros ?

**Lightweight and High Performance**: Delivers excellent performance with minimal resource consumption.  
**Delivery Guarantees**: Provides both at-most-once and at-least-once messaging semantics.  
**User-Friendly**: Easy to deploy and manage, without requiring a dedicated cluster.  
**Scalable**: Designed to scale efficiently in distributed systems and microservices architectures.
