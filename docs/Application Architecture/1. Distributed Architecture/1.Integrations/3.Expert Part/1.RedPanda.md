| **Storage Pattern and Performance Impact**    | Consistent performance across most real-world workloads  <br>  <br>Kafka has a purpose-built log and replication layer optimized for sequential IO, which allows it to deliver high throughput and low latency across a broad set of hardware and workloads. | Performance optimized for selective workloads  <br>  <br>Redpanda can demonstrate low latency and high throughput on simple workloads. However, because it’s optimized for random IO, its performance can significantly degrade over time.  <br>  <br>Several common production configurations, such as high producer count, over 30% disk utilization, enabling message keys, enabling TLS, or running for more than 24 hours can cause severe reductions in performance. |
| **Broker Framework**                          | Purpose-built immutable log  <br>Uses its own purpose-built framework. Data is written in large blocks as high throughput sequential IO, allowing for high performance on drives with even very low IOPS.                                                    | Based on Seastar  <br>Uses the Seastar framework, popularized by the Scylla Database, to implement its immutable log. Writes data in small 16kB chunks by default, requiring very high IOPS SSDs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
