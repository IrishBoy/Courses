# What about examples ?
## Asana SDK
```js
// Install by running `npm i asana`

const Asana = require('asana');

let asanaClient = Asana.ApiClient.instance;
let clientToken = asanaClient.authentications['token'];
clientToken.accessToken = '';

let tasksApiInstance = new Asana.TasksApi();
let options = { 
    "limit": 50,
    "project": "", 
};

const response = await tasksApiInstance.getTasks(options)

console.log(response)
```

This code allows to create a task in Asana without making any http request manualy
