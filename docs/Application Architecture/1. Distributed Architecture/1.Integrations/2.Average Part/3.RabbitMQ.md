### RabbitMQ
RabbitMQ is another example of [Message Brokers](obsidian://open?vault=Laptop&file=Courses%2FApplication%20Architecture%2F1.%20Distributed%20Architecture%2F1.Integrations%2F1.Basic%20Part%2F4.kafka)

It works on [AMQP](obsidian://open?vault=Laptop&file=Courses%2FApplication%20Architecture%2F5.Network%2FProtocols%2FAMQP)
Here you can observe architecture

So, the main difference from [kafka](obsidian://open?vault=Laptop&file=Courses%2FApplication%20Architecture%2F1.%20Distributed%20Architecture%2F1.Integrations%2F1.Basic%20Part%2F4.kafka) is the presence of
- Exchange: Receives messages from producers and routes them to queues based on the rules set by the exchange type. For a queue to receive messages, it must be bound to at least one exchange.
	- - **Direct Exchange**: Routes messages to queues based on an exact match between the message routing key and the queue's binding key.
	- **Fanout Exchange**: Broadcasts messages to all queues bound to the exchange, ignoring the routing key.
	- **Topic Exchange**: Routes messages to queues based on pattern matching between the routing key and the queue's binding key, allowing flexible and wildcard matching.
	- **Headers Exchange**: Routes messages based on matching message header values rather than the routing key.
- Binding: A binding creates a connection between a queue and an exchange.
