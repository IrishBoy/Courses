### RabbitMQ
RabbitMQ is another example of [[4.Pub-sub vs message queue | message broker]]

It works on [[AMQP]]

Here you can observe architecture

So, the main difference from [[5.kafka|kafka]] is the presence of

- Exchange: Receives messages from producers and routes them to queues based on the rules set by the exchange type. For a queue to receive messages, it must be bound to at least one exchange.
-  **Direct Exchange**: Routes messages to queues based on an exact match between the message routing key and the queue's binding key.
- **Fanout Exchange**: Broadcasts messages to all queues bound to the exchange, ignoring the routing key.
- **Topic Exchange**: Routes messages to queues based on pattern matching between the routing key and the queue's binding key, allowing flexible and wildcard matching.
- **Headers Exchange**: Routes messages based on matching message header values rather than the routing key.
- Binding: A binding creates a connection between a queue and an exchange.
