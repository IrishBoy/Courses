Imagine a classic family road trip: 

**Polling** is like the kids constantly asking, "Are we there yet?" and the parents repeatedly responding, "No."

**Webhooks** are like the kids peacefully sleeping in the backseat, only being woken up by the parents when they've reached the destination.

With webhooks, there's no need to keep checking for updates. Instead, the service provider sends the data to a specified URL as soon as it's available.
