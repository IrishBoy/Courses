Every application you has its own set of logic elements

- Authorisation
- Notification
- etc.

Besides the fact that it is one application, all those logic parts may

- Be requested with different frequencies
- Require different data
- Be implemented with different technologies
- Require different states
- etc.

When those restrictions are overwhelming, we can thing towards separating some parts or even creating separate applications. 

In a nutshell, this part will be dedicated to different ways logic can be (or should not be) separated.
