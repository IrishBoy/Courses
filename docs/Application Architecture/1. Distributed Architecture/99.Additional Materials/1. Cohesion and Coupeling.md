### **Cohesion**

Cohesion refers to how closely related and focused the responsibilities of a single module, class, or function are. Basically, this term refers to the measure how different parts of the same module is linked to each other
- **High cohesion**: Modules or classes have a focused, single responsibility, making the code easier to understand, maintain, and modify. For example, a class that manages user authentication should only deal with tasks related to authentication (e.g., logging in, logging out, checking credentials).
- **Low cohesion**: Modules or classes handle unrelated tasks, making the code more complex and harder to maintain. For example, a class that manages both user authentication and payment processing has low cohesion, because these are distinct responsibilities




### **Coupling**

Coupling refers to the degree of direct dependence between different modules or components in a system. This measure evaluates how different parts of one module is connected with another module
- **Low coupling**: Modules or components are independent and interact with each other through well-defined interfaces. This makes the system more flexible, allowing you to change or replace one part without significantly affecting others.
- **High coupling**: Modules are tightly dependent on each other, which makes changes in one module likely to cause issues in others. This can lead to maintenance problems and make it harder to scale or refactor the system.

So, we always should try to aim 

- **high cohesion**
- **low coupling**
