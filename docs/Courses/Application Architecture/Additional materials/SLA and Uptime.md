A Service Level Agreement (SLA) is a widely used term among service providers. It is a formal agreement between the service provider and the customer, outlining the expected level of service uptime. Major cloud providers like Amazon, Google, and Microsoft typically guarantee SLAs of 99.9% uptime or higher.

Uptime is often measured in terms of "nines"â€”the more nines, the greater the reliability. As shown in the table, the number of nines corresponds to the amount of downtime a system can experience.
