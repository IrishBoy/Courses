How to manage it ?

It is managed in [[#Headers]] of the request, in Content-type field


## Headers
Headers are additional data sent with a request to the server, providing key information like the content type of the request body, authentication tokens, or details about the client software. They are distinct from the request body and mainly serve to convey metadata about the request or response.

What can store headers?

- **Accept**: Indicates the content type that the client expects in the response.
- **Content-Type**: Defines the media type of the request body.
- **Authorization**: Provides the authentication token or credentials for the request.
- **User-Agent**: Identifies the software client making the request.
- **Cache-Control**: Controls caching behavior for both the request and response.
- **If-None-Match**: Makes a conditional request based on the [[ETag]] header value.
