So, what if you want to have bidirectional connection since you need lower latency ?
Well, then you need web sockets
Within this approach [[TCP]] is used and connection is up until client or server shuts it down.

**Step 1. The client initiates an [[HTTP]] connection.**

**Step 2. WebSocket establishes a handshake between the client and server that makes WebSocket compatible with  [[HTTP]] ports (80 and 443) and proxies.**

**Step 3. Both the client and server exchange messages freely via an open, persistent connection that doesn’t require continuous polling or new  [[HTTP]] requests.**

**Step 4. The connection remains open until one side closes the channel, at which point the connection closes and the client-server engagement ends.**

It is easy to understand pros but what are cons?

- **Increased Complexity**
- **Resource Consumption**
- **[[Firewall]] and [[Proxy]] Issues**
- **Security Concerns**
- **Lack of Built-in Retry Mechanism**
- **Incompatible with [[1.REST| REST]] APIs**
- **Monitoring and Debugging complexity**
- **No Native Support for Caching**
