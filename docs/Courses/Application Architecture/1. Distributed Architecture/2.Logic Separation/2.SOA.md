However, it is also may be a bit challenging when your product grows and absorbs more and more functionality, since more and more logical modules appear. This leads to increasing difficulty of
- New modules integrations
- Support of the legacy
At this point people started to think about possibility to separate logical modules one from another, making them more independent. This would allow to work on any given module without interference with others. For example, we can distinguish billing service from the rest of the application since 
- We may need to adjust it to [[PCI DSS]]
- It is called from every other module with different parameters and we would like to create universal interface
- It is update really often and we don't want to redeploy the whole application every time.

As a result, SOA has appeared.
SOA stands for Service Oriented Architecture
But what does it mean ? Let's look at a picture, I've stoled from some site a long time ago, while writing my thesis back in 2022
![[Pasted image 20241105074530.png]]
On this diagram you may witness the most common example of SOA, let's break it down
* Software components are divided into services 
- Service is responsible for specific functionality and should perform without knowing anything about other services or system context
- Services are reusable 
- Services are usually integrated with presentation layer via Enterprise Service Bus
- Services are accessible via network protocols such as XML/HTTP or JSON/HTTP
- Services may be built from scratch, but usually are used as imported functions from legacy systems
- Shared database

Also, besides al those facts I'd like to highlight one more, which may spark some debates
-  Repetitive code is fine, we just make ctrl + c , ctrl + v
Why? Because in this approach we focus not on separating logical code parts, but on business side of the process. Meaning that we can freely have the same code in the different services.

Let's dive deeper into advantages and disadvantages
