A **CSRF attack** tricks an authenticated user into making unwanted actions on a web application without their consent. It exploits the trust that a website has in the user's browser.

### **How CSRF Works**

1. **Victim logs into a legitimate website** (e.g., a banking site).
2. The victim's browser **stores an active session (cookie)** for that site.
3. The attacker **tricks the victim** into clicking a malicious link or visiting a page that sends an **unauthorized request** to the legitimate site.
4. The request **automatically includes the victim’s session cookies**, making it appear as if the request is from the victim.
5. The **server processes the request** because it sees a valid session, leading to actions like **changing passwords, transferring money, or deleting accounts**.


#### **Scenario: Online Banking Website**

Imagine you are logged into **YourBank.com** and the site allows money transfers via a simple HTTP request:

```bash
POST 
https://yourbank.com/transfer Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded  amount=1000&to=attacker_account`
```


Your session is authenticated using a **cookie** that is automatically included in every request you make.

### **Step-by-Step Attack Execution**

#### **Step 1: Victim Logs into Their Bank Account**

- You visit **YourBank.com**, enter your username and password, and successfully log in.
- The site sets a **session cookie** in your browser (`session_id=xyz123`).
- Now, any request to **YourBank.com** is automatically authenticated using this cookie.

#### **Step 2: Attacker Prepares a Malicious Website**

- The attacker creates a website (**evil.com**) with an embedded malicious request.
- The site includes an **invisible auto-submitting form**:

```html
<body>     <h1>Win a Free iPhone! Click Below:</h1>    
 <form action="https://yourbank.com/transfer" method="POST">       
 <input type="hidden" name="amount" value="1000"> 
  <input type="hidden" name="to" value="attacker_account"> 
- <input type="submit" value="Click to Claim Prize">
- </form>
- </body>
```



OR the attacker may use JavaScript to **auto-submit** the form when the page loads:

```html
<body onload="document.forms[0].submit()">   
<form action="https://yourbank.com/transfer" method="POST">
<input type="hidden" name="amount" value="1000">
<input type="hidden" name="to" value="attacker_account">
</form>
</body>`
```



---

#### **Step 3: Victim Clicks the Malicious Link**

- You receive a phishing email or see an ad promising a free iPhone.
- You visit **evil.com**.
- The page **automatically submits the hidden form** to **YourBank.com**.
- Since your browser is still logged into YourBank.com, **it automatically includes the session cookie (`session_id=xyz123`) in the request**.

---

#### **Step 4: The Bank Processes the Request**

- YourBank.com **sees a valid request with an authenticated session**.
- The bank transfers **$1,000 to the attacker's account** because it believes the request came from you.
- **You lose money without even knowing it happened.**

### **Variations of CSRF Attacks**

CSRF attacks are not limited to bank transfers. Attackers can exploit any action that requires authentication:

1. **Change Email or Password**
    
    - If a site allows email/password changes via a simple request:
```bash
POST https://example.com/change_email 
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded  

email=attacker@gmail.com  
```
    
    - An attacker can force a victim to change their email to **attacker@gmail.com**, locking them out.
2. **Delete Account**
    
```bash
   GET https://example.com/delete_account 
```
    
    
    
    - If a website **doesn't require extra verification**, a CSRF attack can delete a user’s account.
3. **Purchase Items (E-Commerce Sites)**
    
```bash
   POST https://shop.com/buy Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded  product_id=123&quantity=10
```

    
    - The attacker can trick a victim into unknowingly buying expensive products.
