When discussing data storage in computer systems, persistence refers to the ability of data to remain intact even after the process that created it has ended. This requires writing data to non-volatile storage.

### **Approaches to data persistence**

Understanding persistence involves examining four primary data store designs and their relationship to persistent storage:

1. **Pure in-memory storage:**  
    These systems, like memcached or Scalaris, do not write data to non-volatile storage, sacrificing durability for speed. They are best suited for caching but not for scenarios requiring persistence.
    
2. **In-memory with periodic snapshots:**  
    Solutions such as Oracle Coherence or Redis periodically save in-memory data to disk. While some persistence is provided, there is a risk of data loss between snapshots.
    
3. **Disk-based with update-in-place writes:**  
    Systems like MySQL ISAM or MongoDB write updates directly to disk. These approaches ensure persistence but may have performance trade-offs compared to purely in-memory systems.
    
4. **Commitlog-based systems:**  
    Traditional OLTP databases like Oracle or SQL Server use logs to commit data changes, ensuring durability and persistence for transactional workloads.

### **Performance vs. persistence trade-offs**

In-memory systems offer exceptional speed but are constrained by memory size and lack of durability. They are ideal for workloads with a small "hot" data subset but unsuitable for applications requiring full persistence. Systems leveraging disk-based or commitlog designs provide robust persistence at the cost of slower performance.
